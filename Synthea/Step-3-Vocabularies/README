DOWNLOAD THE VOCABULARIES
Go to https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/ and sign in/up
Then choose the vocabularies for the terminologies.
Give a name to the downloaded zip file
Unzip the file


Note based on my (little) experience:
The first time I didn't change the ticked choices and donwloaded the stuff which was about 4.5 GB unzipped. The insertion failed on the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv that was above 2GB
Then I unchecked some of the dictionaries and get around 2.7 GB of space occupied. The insertion succeeded.
Probably, if needed, some insertion can be done later.
